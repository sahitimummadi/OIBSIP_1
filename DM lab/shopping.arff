The growing overlap between human and animal areas is the root cause of human-wildlife conflict (HWC), It can take several forms, including the killing of livestock and attacks on people by wild animals and the retaliatory killing of animals by angered community members,

In this research, we investigate how incorporating technology into conservation initiatives can transform HWC management by offering more practical and long-lasting approaches to conflict resolution.


Objective

1. Raise awareness about mitigating human-wildlife conflict.
2. Showcase technology for conflict reduction.
3. Educate on coexistence practices.


Analysis

Mapping : Smart collars follow a wild animal's daily activity and locations using GPS and accelerometer technologies. People will be able to predict behaviour, and lessen conflicts between people and animals.

UAVs
Ecologists and biologists have built a conservation drone that is equipped with cameras, sensors, and GPS to monitor wildlife and count endangered species.

Using  AI-embedded camera 
This has taken over the traditional camera trap system and directly sends notifications to the Forest officials. Filtering using embedded AI saves on the transmission of many unwanted images.


Conclusion

Through the use of technology in conservation initiatives, HWC management can be transformed. UAVs, smart collars, and cameras with AI built-in provide creative ways to keep an eye on wildlife and successfully diffuse confrontations. 
We can ensure the preservation of livelihoods and biodiversity by promoting peaceful connections between human populations and wildlife through awareness-raising, education, and the adoption of coexistence practices.
